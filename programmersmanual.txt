            - password for the account (DONE)
                - password should also have a button using the password generator concept to generate passwords 8 - 14 chars long (need to do)

            - a save button to save the entry or updates to the db (DONE)

UI decisions will come later
I want to get the functionality down first

5/11/22

Most of the funtionality is done
Most of the error handling is done
I need to style the application
Then package the application in Electron


5/13

Styles today 
going to work in css to make the application look nice
Mostly going to use Materialize css 

going to add a 'go to website' button
but i should check if the website field contains a valid url to show the button

found a package called url-validator12

need to add http:// before all the website urls for the validator to work
done

migtrated the react app to electron
I need to ensure the 'open website' button opens a web broswer instead of a new electron window

I'm running into trouble with the db
the json server needs to be running for the app to work so i must find a way around that
