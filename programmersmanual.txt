Schema

    Entry:
        String: Company name (required)
        String: company website 
        String: username or email address (required)
        String: password (required)

need a db decision 
    -mysql
    -mongodb

need to be able to store the data locally in a hosted file
dont know if mongo can do this 


Set up:
    
    users need a main password    
        - 20-25 chars long (something they can remember)

    once user is logged in 
        - list of company names
            - alphabetically sorted 
            - able to type to search also 
    
    User clicks on company 
        - page should display
            - company name 
            - company website (if there is one)
                - a button to open the browser to website 
            - username or email address for the account 
            - password for the account 
                - password should also have a button using the password generator concept to generate passwords 8 - 14 chars long

            - a save button to save the entry or updates to the db

UI decisions will come later
I want to get the functionality down first
